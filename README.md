# Image Grid Viewer


I have another code in C++ which returns a few images as output. I usually need to see all these images to evaluate my algorithms. On the other hand I am tryning to learn Python for other purposes. Anyway, this is my first PyQt program, which happens to be one that I am going to use on a daily basis.

# Usage: 
- $ python igridvu.py lena

OR

- $ python igridvu.py lena igridvu_suffix.txt

where 'lena' is the name or full path of the images, including the identical part, and 'igridvu_suffix.txt' contains a list of endings (see an axample in repository!).
